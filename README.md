# Pokemon-Episode-Parser
This is really messy code that I used to make a list of Pokemon that appears in each Pokemon anime episode

When I want to get an updated list, I first run apicalling.py, then I use the text file that is produced in APIParser.java.

Included in the repo is apicallingresults.txt, which is the output from apicalling.py, and expectedresults.txt, which is the output from APIParser.java
