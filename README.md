# Pokemon-Episode-Parser
This is really messy code that I used to make a list of Pokemon that appears in each aired Pokemon anime episode.

These programs take Bulbapedia articles and take the sections that list the Pokemon in the episode to make a list of Pokemon per episode

When I want to get an updated list, I first run apicalling.py, then I use the text file that is produced in APIParser.java.

Included in the repo is apicallingresults.txt, which is the output from apicalling.py, and expectedresults.txt, which is the output from APIParser.java. Both files are updated up to the 1061st episode.
